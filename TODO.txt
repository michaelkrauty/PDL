if cell = > 4 and less than 10 assign Role - "Column Title" + " " + "Novice"
if cell = > 9 and less than 25 assign Role- "Column Title" + " " + "Operator". Remove Novice
if cell = > 24 and less than 50 assign Role- "Column Title" + " " + "Master". Remove Operator
if cell = > 49 and less than 100 assign Role- "Column Title" + " " + "Grand Master". Remove Master
if cell = > 99 assign Role- "Column Title" + " " + "Ultra Clapper". Remove Grand Master

each player would have a RANK role, and an ELO role by default
and then only one potential role per quest that they had undertaken

so Banana has Roles:
RANK 2
Rating 1200
AWP Novice
-
but Mr Pink only has:
Rank 2
Rating 1200
-
Maverick has:
Rank 3
Rating 1175
-
then if maverick queries !quest
it returns:
awp - 0
One Hand- 0
Pistol - 1
Snd - 0

possibly: Roles for #1-#3, top 5, top 10, top 20
